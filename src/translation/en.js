My stint in QA has been instrumental in developing a meticulous attention to detail and a profound understanding of user experience. My unconventional path into software development has not only diversified my skill set but also enriched my problem-solving approach. I am driven by my passion for coding, always ready to embrace new challenges, and remain committed to continuous learning in this dynamic field of technology.
