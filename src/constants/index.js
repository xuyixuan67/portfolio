      "I highly recommend Tammy Xu, a software developer whose expertise and dedication have consistently led to remarkable outcomes. Having worked alongside Tammy for over 4 years at Elo Software, I've had the firsthand opportunity to witness her ability to learn new concepts and skills quickly, even when it's an entirely new language or environment. Tammy's ability to understand both new and existing front-end and back-end developments is impressive. She has worked on multiple projects, both solo and as part of a team. Notably, on PhishProof and our e-learning platform. Tammy's innovative use of PHP and MySQL greatly enhanced our web applications' functionality and user experience. Her keen eye for detail in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript has always helped us solve bugs before going into production. What sets Tammy apart is her problem-solving ability. Whenever faced with a challenging bottleneck in our systems, she would not quit until the problem had a solution or was moving towards a solution. Her proactive and innovative thinking has been instrumental in overcoming challenges. Beyond her technical skills, Tammy is a true team player, consistently fostering a collaborative and inclusive environment. Tammy has also shown leadership qualities, leading the QA team by example and significantly contributing to our team's professional development. In light of Tammy Xu's outstanding skills, professional attitude, and unwavering dedication, I wholeheartedly recommend them for any web development, SaaS, front-end, back-end, or QA role. I am confident she will be an invaluable asset to your team. Please feel free to contact me here on LinkedIn if you require any further information.",
